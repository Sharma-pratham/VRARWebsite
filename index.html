        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>My method fills in a significant gap in the state of VR technology. Sports and other physical activity training may undergo a revolution if quick, complicated actions can be precisely recorded and replicated in a virtual reality setting without the need for extra sensors or cameras. This would make training more efficient and accessible. In addition to increasing the accuracy and realism of the training simulations, this technique may improve user experience by lowering the requirement for additional hardware, which could increase skill acquisition and transfer to real-world circumstances.
For my project, I created trajectory predictions using an LSTM model that was trained using golf club swing coordinates. The original golf club asset will be seen in a ghostly form along the expected trajectory. Rapid collisions will be made possible by this prediction model.
To sum up, the initiative is important because it has the potential to improve the effectiveness of VR training applications, particularly in fields where quick and intricate physical movements are necessary. Your research has the potential to significantly advance the field of VR training by utilizing machine learning to enhance the capabilities of VR controllers, hence broadening its scope and efficacy in diverse fields.
